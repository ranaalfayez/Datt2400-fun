TITLE: SONG OF THE BEES

I was inspired again by the relationship betwee creative coding and the perfect spontaneity of nature. I initiatlly set out to create a simulation of bee movements and declining hive populations. As the work developed, the project took on a deeper story-based approach centered around 'The Last Bee on Earth'. While not a traditional game with 'win/lose' mechanics, Song of The Bees is an explorative game that takes the player on a narraitve journey with the Bee through its busy working days, concluding with an open-ended, ambigious ending. 

I wanted the game to be relaxing, calming and almost meditative in its gameplay that I can continue building on.  I think this is one of the key strengths of the game -- For example, While the premise is simple, I can easily see myself adding new goals, growing the world design and continuing the story.
