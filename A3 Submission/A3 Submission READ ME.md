**TITLE: SONG OF THE BEES**

I was inspired again by the relationship betwee creative coding and the perfect spontaneity of nature. I initiatlly set out to create a simulation of bee movements and declining hive populations. As the work developed, the project took on a deeper story-based approach centered around 'The Last Bee on Earth'. While not a traditional game with 'win/lose' mechanics, Song of The Bees is an explorative game that takes the player on a narraitve journey with the Bee through its busy working days, concluding with an open-ended, ambigious ending. 

_The Developed Sketches:_

From a coding perspective, I used a combination of Object Oriented Coding and lots of straightforward blocks of code that came alive through experimentation. This disorganized approach made it easy to be spontaneous but diffifult to make edits over longer periods of time. I would often find myself rewriting chunks of code because I simply did not remember what I was thinking. 

The game involves movement using both the keyboard to complete tasks, and via mouse movement during the opening and closing sequence to add an element of exploration and freedom of movement. The 'Song of the Bee' itself is a Korean R&B song cover that I felt suited the melancholic atmosphere of the solitary but hard working insect. The purpose of the Song was to create unique motivator or 'why' the player should care about completing the tasks with the bee; the faint sounds of the song and its softly rising volume as the player gets closer to the pollen creates a push and pull with the player that entices them to continue searching. This was created by creating invisible borders around the tasks that would trigger an increase/decrease in the amplitude of the song.

The linked Youtube Playlist was EXTREMELY helpful with putting together the collision mechanics and my 'Sprite' class.

I wanted the game to be relaxing, calming and almost meditative in its gameplay that I can continue building on.  I think this is one of the key strengths of the game -- For example, While the premise is simple, I can easily see myself adding new goals, growing the world design and continuing the story. In particular, a next step I would include would be to add animation to the main character. I was able to partially achieve this for the final bees by remixing an existing source animation and found that it added a lot of life.
